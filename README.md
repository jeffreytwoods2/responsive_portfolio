# responsive_portfolio

Overview:

A project to build up my portfolio with mobile-first, responsive web design. Includes portfolio and contact information


Home Page:

A header that takes up its own row, with another row nested beneath that contains a table (which also takes up the entire row next to an image)
Table contains simple biographical info that could be of interest to companies


Portfolio Page:

I am currently building up my portfolio and do not have any finished projects yet (except for this one, sort of). 
Portfolio projects are just placeholder images from via.placeholder.com


Contact Page:

Similar layout to home page; first row is just a header with an h1 tag
Second row, nested within, is another table, this time with relevant contact info
